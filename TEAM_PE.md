# Team Policies and Expectations

## Instructor's Expectations and Responsabilities for All Students

### Project Iteration Responsibilities of the Team (as a Team)
* Together, determine the distribution of work and design this distribution so that it is possible for each team member to contribute a roughly equal effort toward the success of the project. Make your best guess about this at the start of the project, and refine the responsibilities if needed as you go. Consult the instructor if any issues arise or you need clarifications.

#### Distribution of Work
* We will divide the tasks into categories based on the type of task they are, i.e. software changes, documentation, tests, etc. Then, we will assign the tasks to spread out the work and time demands as evenly as possible. For longer tasks and important documentation like UMLs, multiple group members will collaborate to ensure progess is being made. If team members need help with their tasks, they can reach out to others for assistance and everyone can contribute ideas and solutions to any possible problems.

### Project Responsibilities of the Individual
* Individually, contribute to the success of the team according to the policies and schedule agreed upon by all team members. Individually, create the opportunity for everyone in your group to succeed at being a good team member - don't do all the work yourself.

## Additional Expectations and Responsabilities Set by The Students
Establish your own additional team policies around the following aspects:

* Expectations for regular group meetings and synchronous class/lab attendance.
* Expectations for frequency, method, and response time for communication on Piazza.
* Expectations for using other forms of electronic communication.
* Expectations for frequency of contributions to the project.
* Expectations on how to communicate when things are not working as we expected.
* Others.

#### Additional Expectations and Responsabilities
* Everyone should respond to communications from other team members in a timely manner, and make it known if they will be unavailable to contact for a period of time
* Attend class/lab when needed/as requested by other teammates
* Contribute regularly based on the tasks you are assigned and the expected timeline provided for each project iteration
* Be respectful and calm when running into issues with the project, teammates, or any other difficulties
